# SpacePictures

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


User has to choose the Rover in select menu, then he can choose Camera depending on a rover type he chose. Then he can type in sol number. If value isn't typed it automatically becomes 1000 for results.

Then user clicks the button to Dive into space and pictures with earth date are loaded. There is a pagination where user can select items per page and switch between them. In my opinion, material paging is much more efficient that a Load more  button because it provides better UX.

This app is tablet/mobile friendly.
